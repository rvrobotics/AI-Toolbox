        "This class inherits from any valid MDP model type, so that it can\n"
        "use its base methods, and it builds from those. Templated inheritance\n"
        "was chosen to improve performance and keep code small, instead of\n"
        "doing composition.\n"
        "\n"
        "A POMDP is an MDP where the agent, at each timestep, does not know\n"
        "in which state it is. Instead, after each action is performed, it\n"
        "obtains an 'observation', which offers some information as to which\n"
        "new state the agent has transitioned to. This observation is\n"
        "determined by an 'observation function', that maps S'xAxO to a\n"
        "probability: the probability of obtaining observation O after taking\n"
        "action A and *landing* in state S'.\n"
        "\n"
        "Since now its knowledge is imperfect, in order to represent the\n"
        "knowledge of the state it is currently in, the agent is thus forced\n"
        "to use Beliefs: probability distributions over states.\n"
        "\n"
        "The way a Belief works is that, after each action and observation,\n"
        "the agent can reason as follows: given my previous Belief\n"
        "(distribution over states) that I think I was in, what is now the\n"
        "probability that I transitioned to any particular state? This new\n"
        "Belief can be computed from the Model, given that the agent knows\n"
        "the distributions of the transition and observation functions.\n"
        "\n"
        "Turns out that a POMDP can be viewed as an MDP with an infinite\n"
        "number of states, where each state is essentially a Belief. Since a\n"
        "Belief is a vector of real numbers, there are infinite of them, thus\n"
        "the infinite number of states. While POMDPs can be much more\n"
        "powerful than MDPs for modeling real world problems, where\n"
        "information is usually not perfect, it turns out that this\n"
        "infinite-state property makes them so much harder to solve\n"
        "perfectly, and their solutions much more complex.\n"
        "\n"
        "A POMDP solution is composed by several policies, which apply in\n"
        "different ranges of the Belief space, and suggest different actions\n"
        "depending on the observations received by the agent at each\n"
        "timestep. The values of those policies can be, in the same way,\n"
        "represented as a number of value vectors (called alpha vectors in\n"

        "The difference between this class and the POMDP::Model class is that\n"
        "this class stores observations in a sparce matrix. This results in a\n"
        "possibly slower access to individual probabilities, but immeasurably\n"
        "speeds up computation with some classes of planning algorithms in\n"
        "case the number of possible observations is very small with respect\n"
